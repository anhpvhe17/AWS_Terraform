This Terraform code:

Configures the AWS provider using a region variable.

Creates two S3 buckets:

log_bucket: Stores access logs.

data_bucket: Stores main data.

Applies a bucket policy to log_bucket so the S3 logging service can write logs to it.

Enables Server Access Logging on data_bucket, directing logs to log_bucket with a prefix.
